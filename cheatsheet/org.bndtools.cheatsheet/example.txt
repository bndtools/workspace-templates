Hello World!

This is an example file for testing bnd file macros:
- ${cat;example.txt} - reads this file
- ${base64;example.txt} - encodes this file as base64
- ${digest;MD5;example.txt} - computes MD5 hash of this file
- ${digest;SHA-256;example.txt} - computes SHA-256 hash of this file

Use this file to experiment with file-based bnd macros.
